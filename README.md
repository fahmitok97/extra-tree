# Extra Trees Classifier

Extra Trees Classifier Implementation for Machine Learning Course.

### Introduction

Extra Trees classifier is inspired by random forests, that is using ensemble method to reduce posibility of overfitting. The method drops the idea of using bootstrap copies of the learning sample and instead of trying to find an optimal cut-point for each one of the K randomly chosen features at each node, it selects a cut-point at random.

### Usage

We've already prepared our playground for testing the algorithm, you just have to run `python3 index.py`.

the dataset contains 100 datapoints that has 2 features which every of the datapoint belongs to one of 2 classes. We also done cross validation to evaluate if our model is overfitting or not.
